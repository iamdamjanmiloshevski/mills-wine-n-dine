#### Prerequisites
To run this Express server locally you'll have to install several things on your machine so that it can be accessed via http://localhost:3000 once everything is set correctly. You may change the port if you want, but 3000 is default. 
To set it up correctly please follow the steps above

## 1. Installation

    1. Installing node.js (you can skip this step if you already have node installed on your machine)
       - To install Node.js go to [NodeJS official   page] (https://nodejs.org/en/) and install the latest version available. After the installation finishes, open Terminal (MacOS/Linux) or PowerShell,Command Prompt (Windows) and type `node -v` and it should print you the version you installed. For example `v15.8.0`
    2. Installing npm (Node Package Manager)
        - Go to the folder where you cloned this project and open it via Terminal or PowerShell/Command Prompt (or navigate to it in the terminal)
        - Type `npm install`. If there some errors during the installation follow the instructions in the terminal to fix them. After installation is complete type `npm -n` and it should print you the version of npm installed. Ex. `7.5.1` 
    3. After installing npm, you should install several additional npm packages required for this project. 

## 2. MongoDB
This server is powered by MongoDB
